- 👋 Hi, I’m @vromp5
- 👀 I’m interested in learning git, sometimes it makes me want to tear my hair out.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying computer science in college and learning Java and C++ so that I don't starve to death.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, as I need experience.
- 📫 How to reach me: vromp5@gmail.com
